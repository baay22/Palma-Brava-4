                <h1>How to Decorate a Home Office That Will Inspire You to Work</h1>
                <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing companies to send their employees to work from home, people have dedicated space in their homes where they can focus and complete their work. While the thought of working from home can be enticing to many employees, welcoming work in the sanctuary of your living space and dedicating a home office space can be a daunting task.</p>
                <p>Your home office should be a place where you can focus and enjoy working; however, it should integrate comfortably into the rest of your living space. While being creative with your home office is not your top work-life priority, decorating a home office you love can inspire you to work better. Luckily, there are plenty of home office decor ideas that you can follow.</p>
                <p>Here are some modern home office decoration and design tips that are worth considering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Maximize Vertical Space</b></li>
                <p>Proper organization is crucial, especially in a small space. Using accessories, such as shelves, hanging file folders, rods with hooks, and even dedicated wall systems help organize office supplies and make them readily available when you need them.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Keep Distraction to a Minimum</b></li>
                <p>Your home office should be set up for success. When designing your home office, make sure to anticipate and avoid potential pain points you will likely experience while working. For instance, interior designers claim that the placement of the furniture can lead to distractions. 
                    Decide carefully what you will be using to decorate your home office space. Do fun office decors make your workspace feel cozier and more functional? Or do they pull your focus from your work? Your home office decoration items should be useful and not be causes for disruption.</p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Let There Be Light</b></li>
                <p>Many offices are known for their stark lighting due to the use of fluorescent bulbs. Offices use sterile, cold lighting due to one basic work principle — sufficient lighting can help make work easier.</p>
                <p>Limiting the lighting in your home office can make eye strain caused by long hours of staring at a computer worse. As much as possible, make sure you have natural light and have supplementary lighting where it falls short.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Choose the Right Desk and Office Chair</b></li>
                <section class="head">
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img style="height: 288px; width: 480px" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/4781/3575/files/Invest-in-a-desk-that-accommodates-both-sitting-and-standing-positions_480x480.jpg?v=1645717024" alt="Palma Brava Home Furnishings and Accessories">
             </div>
                <p>Since the <a href="https://palmabrava.com/collections/desk-office-chairs"> <u>desk and office chair</u></a> are the main features in your home office, be sure to choose the right design and how much space you need. If you are dealing with various paperwork every day, buy a desk that offers sufficient space for your laptop and a small space where you can safely place your cup of coffee.</p>
                <p>If you are <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-sitting-health"> <u>working long hours at your workspace</u></a> everyday, choose a desk design that allows you to switch positions. Using a desk that accommodates both sitting and standing positions helps reduce back pain and blood pressure.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Add an Informal Seating in Your Home Office</b></li>
                <p>A home office should not only be a functional space. Adding an informal seating (a small sofa and coffee table) can make your home office feel cozier and welcoming. It provides you a spot away from your work desk where you can enjoy your morning coffee or a quick break.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Built-In Storage</b></li>
                <p>Storage is crucial, and you can even use it as a jumping-off point for your home office design. You can set up a customized built-in storage that is specific to your work needs. However, if built-in storage is not an option, you can use a daybed (with a storage area underneath) that can pass off a sofa to maximize your home office space.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Give Yourself a Nice View</b></li>
                <section class="head">
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img style="height: 288px; width: 480px" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/4781/3575/files/Enjoy-the-beautiful-outdoor-view-while-working_480x480.jpg?v=1645716580" alt="Palma Brava Home Furnishings and Accessories">
             </div>
                 <p>An open floor plan is a good option if you want to match your interior decor to ensure a subtle flow in between rooms. This option is perfect for people who do not want a traditional office design. Having the choice to view your home’s interior while being able to enjoy the beautiful sight of your outdoor landscape can provide you with a sense of peaceful relaxation. Incorporating seeded glass doors enables natural light to penetrate the room for a light and airy feel and make your home office space appear larger. 
                 However, if you do not have many windows, choose a wall colour (white or light wood tones) that is light and airy. Use gauzy curtains or a neutral roman shade instead of heavy draperies. You can also place several potted plants to bring a bit of outdoors into your space.</p>

                <li><b>Add Personal Touches</b></li>
                <p>While there are many office decor ideas for work, it is important to choose home office decor that represent you and your personal style. Whether your space is big or small, your home office design ideas should offer you the flexibility to be creative with colours and patterns.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Get a Colourful Rag</b></li>
                <p>Placing a colourful <a href="https://www.jaipurrugs.com/blog/choose-right-rug-for-home-office-decor"> <u>area rug</u></a> is one of the most popular modern home office decorating ideas that promote visual interest and soothing sound absorption. Keeping your home office decoration simple and clean helps make your home office space looks sleeker. You can also give your room some texture by adding green foliage.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Combine Old and New</b></li>
                <p>The combination of modern and vintage home decor can give your home office space a warm feeling. For example, a beautiful antique rug can look perfect with a pair of new red chairs. Limit your <a href="https://palmabrava.com/collections/wall-art"> <u>wall art</u></a> to black and white images to avoid overwhelming the space with colours. These small home office design ideas can give you a beautiful and comfortable room to work in.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Be a Minimalist</b></li>
                <p>Many of the world’s most successful people prefer a minimalist design. A well-organized workspace with simple office decor and a neutral colour palette helps free your mind, spark creativity, and increase productivity.</p>
                <p>The best way to decorate a home office is to keep it simple. Start with the essentials, such as the desk, chair, and lamp. From there, you can slowly find other office furniture and decor that will inspire your best work. It takes time to decorate a home office, but when you find a furniture store in Milton that sells quality home office decor and furniture pieces.</p>
